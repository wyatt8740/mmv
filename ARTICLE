Subject: MMV patch HIGH priority
Date: 9 Jun 90 21:03:03 GMT
Distribution: comp
Organization: Cornell Univ. CS Dept. Ithaca NY
Status: RO

I'm posting this for Vladimir Lanin:

The following patch fixes a number of bugs in mmv 1.0
(as distributed on comp.sources.unix)
and provides V7 compatibility.
The new version is known as mmv 1.01b.

Since one of the bugs can result in the unintended DELETION
of the source file, it is imperative that the old version
be replaced with the new one.

The two major bugs fixed are:
1) in its BSD reincarnation, whenever a file had to be moved between devices
(by copying, then deleting), mmv 1.0 made a symbolic link to "/" instead
of copying the file. It still deleted the original, though. Oops!
2) the uppercase/lowercase conversion feature did not work.
